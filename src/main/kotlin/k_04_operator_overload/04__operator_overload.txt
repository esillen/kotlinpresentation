### 04 - Operator overload ###

# Basic idea:

Allow redefinition of operators such as
+
-
+=
++
[i]
<
...and more


For example Set<Person> + Person ====(becomes)====> Set<Person> (with the person included)
The "+" symbol is redefined.


In java this is impossible*
Workaround is Set<Person>.add(Person) ====(becomes)====> Set<Person>


Can be abused (c++)
Can also be used for good.


Let's look at some examples
