### 04 - Operator overload ###

# Basic idea:

Allow reassignment of operators such as
+
-
+=
++
[i]
<
...and more


For example Set<Person> + Person ====(becomes)===> Set<Person> (with the person included)
The "+" symbol is redefined.


In java this is impossible*


Can be abused (c++ anyone?)
Can also be used for good.
Let's look at some examples
