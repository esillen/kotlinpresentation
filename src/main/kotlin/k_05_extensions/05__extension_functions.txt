### 05 - Extension function

# Basic idea:

Allow extension of classes (and more) without changing the source code and without reflection.



Let's set the stage:

You need a function that "makes a copy but changes a field"

Person("Anna", ...) -> Person("Klara", ...)



You don't want to change the class itself (or you can't)

Java solution:

private Thing makeCopy(Thing oldThing, ThingField newField)



Let's look at extension functions that help with this.
