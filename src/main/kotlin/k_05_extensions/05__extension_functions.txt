### 05 - Extension function

# Basic idea:

Allow extension of classes (and more) without changing the source code.



Example problem:

You need a function that "makes a copy but changes a field"

Person("Anna", ...) -> Person("Klara", ...)

You don't want to change the class itself (or you can't)



Java solution:

private Thing makeCopy(Thing oldThing, ThingField newField) {
    ...
}



Let's look at extension functions that help with this.
